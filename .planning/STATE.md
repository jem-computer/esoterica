## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v1.3 Planning:**
- 3 phases derived from 14 requirements (depth=quick)
- Architecture refactor first to enable lazy card loading
- Card content as single phase (4 suits share same structure)
- Wizard enhancement last (depends on content existing)

**Phase 16-01 Decisions:**
- Extract card data to separate files for lazy loading after draw
- Use horizontal rules (---) as visual separators between cards
- Document elemental associations in Minor Arcana placeholder files
- Card data format: "## Card N: Name" for easy Claude Read tool lookup

**Phase 16-02 Decisions:**
- Card Index table format: # | Name | Suit | Keywords for quick lookup
- Loading instructions explicitly reference cards/major-arcana.md
- Maintainer notes updated to reflect lazy loading architecture
- Orchestration pattern: Index → Identify → Load → Interpret

**Phase 17-01 Decisions:**
- All 14 Wands cards express Fire element (will, action, creativity, passion)
- Pip cards (Ace-10) follow journey progression narrative through numbered meanings
- Court cards embed archetypal personality in Themes field (no separate sections)
- Situations field contains concrete scenarios, not abstract keywords

**Phase 17-02 Decisions:**
- Water element expressed through emotion/relationship domain across all 14 Cups cards
- Court cards use standard format with archetypal personality embedded in Themes
- Pip cards follow narrative journey: Ace (seed) → 10 (completion)
- Situations are concrete scenarios not abstract keywords

**Phase 17-03 Decisions:**
- Balanced difficult cards (3, 9, 10) with constructive perspective while honoring pain
- Emphasized concrete situations over abstract keywords throughout Swords suit
- Maintained voice consistency with Major Arcana quality

**Phase 17-04 Decisions:**
- Pip cards (Ace-10) follow journey progression narrative
- Court cards embed archetypal personality in Themes rather than separate section
- All situations are concrete scenarios (e.g., "Starting a business") not abstract keywords
- Earth element expressed through material/work/body/finances/practical concerns

**Phase 18-01 Decisions:**
- Major Arcana only listed first and described as "recommended" for backwards compatibility
- Question 2.5 inserted between spread and mode for logical flow
- Conditional shuf ranges applied across all spread types (Single, Three-Card, Claude Suggests, Custom)
- Deck choice determines card pool range consistently across all spread/mode combinations

**Phase 18-02 Decisions:**
- Card numbering follows suit-based scheme (Wands 22-35, Cups 36-49, Swords 50-63, Pentacles 64-77)
- Optional 'of' in Minor Arcana names (users naturally say 'three cups' not 'three of cups')
- Court card abbreviations support natural shortcuts (Q, K, Kn, P) for physical deck users
