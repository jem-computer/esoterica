## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v1.4 Roadmap:**
- 4 phases derived from 6 requirements (depth=quick)
- Video element with scroll-driven currentTime (NOT canvas + frame images)
- Vanilla JS only -- zero runtime dependencies preserved
- ffmpeg for video compression
- Phase 21 (illustrations) independent of video phases -- could parallelize
- Source video: /Users/jem/Downloads/weavy-Kling First & Last Frame-2026-01-28 at 11.59.12.mp4

**Phase 19 Scroll Video:**
- CRF 28 yields 1.8MB from 25MB source (93% reduction)
- h264 Main profile, Level 4.0, faststart, no audio
- Video committed to repo (1.8MB, small enough for git — no CI pipeline for generation)
- 300vh hero with sticky inner container, scroll maps to video.currentTime
- BASE_URL trailing slash bug found and fixed

**Phase 20 Mobile + A11y (Plan 01):**
- Poster img hidden by default, shown via CSS reduced-motion query (no JS needed for swap)
- Video src removed via JS for reduced-motion users to prevent 1.8MB download
- Hero collapses to 100vh/100svh in reduced-motion mode
- Resize handler reuses existing ticking flag and updateVideoTime function
- iOS Safari: poster attribute + #t=0.001 for first-frame display

**Phase 20 Mobile + A11y (Plan 02):**
- SVG chevron scroll hint in hero, appears after 1.5s with bounce animation
- Animation gated behind prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference
- JS fades hint at >20% scroll progress, restores CSS animation on scroll-back
- display: none in reduced-motion media query

**Phase 21 Gateway Illustrations:**
- Nano Banana Pro via Replicate API for line art generation (60+ variations)
- Custom stamp-filter.mjs replicates Photoshop Stamp filter (sharp: grayscale → blur → threshold)
- User style suffix: "fineliner line art, heavy stippling texture, imperfect, rough drawings..."
- CSS breakout layout: margin-left 50% + translateX(-50%) pattern
- Dark mode: filter invert(1) on img only (not caption)
- IntersectionObserver scroll reveal with threshold 0.15, rootMargin -50px
- Archive saved to ~/Pictures/esoterica-illustrations-archive/

**Phase 22 Footer + Polish:**
- Re-encoded hero.mp4 with keyframes every 10 frames (25 I-frames) for Chrome scroll
- CRF 28 for 2.6MB file size (tradeoff: larger but smooth seeking)
- canplaythrough event + 3s timeout fallback for poster hiding
- Semantic footer with Temple of Silicon link to github.com/temple-of-silicon
- Lighthouse score: 94 (desktop)
- Cross-browser verified: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge

### Pending Todos

- [x] Debug Chrome scroll animation lag (works fine in Safari) -- FIXED in 22-01
- [ ] Let users save readings to file (future candidate)
- [ ] Debug ugly argument parsing in Skill
- [ ] Explore subagent benefits for tarot skill
- [ ] Integrate tarot with GSD workflow while keeping independence
- [ ] Remove .claude-plugin directory (not configured properly)
- [ ] Add contribution policy - coven members only (no random PRs)

### Blockers/Concerns
