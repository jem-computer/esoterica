## Accumulated Decisions

Decisions made during execution that affect future work:

| Decision | Phase | Context | Rationale |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Context isolation via fork | 01-01 | Tarot skill | Prevents reading context bleeding into main session |
| Card numbering 0-21 | 01-01 | Major Arcana | Matches canonical tarot deck (The Fool = 0) |
| Shell injection for randomness | 01-01 | Card selection | Uses system entropy for true random selection |
| Voice system deferred | 01-01 | Skill structure | Phase 3 will implement, placeholders in place |
| Embedded card data in prompt | 02-01 | Card meanings | All card knowledge in SKILL.md, no external files |
| 4-section card structure | 02-01 | Card definitions | Themes/Situations/Shadows/Symbols for each card |
| Subagent as tarot reader | 02-01 | Interpretation | Directs subagent to interpret FOR user, not provide lookup |
| Archetypal language | 02-01 | Card meanings | Enables contextual connections to diverse situations |

Stopped at: Completed Phase 2 Plan 01 (major-arcana-meanings)
Resume file: None

## Next Steps

1. Plan Phase 3: Voice System
   - Implement Mystic (witchy) and Grounded (practical) voices
   - Add voice-specific interpretation styles
   - Handle voice selection and switching
2. Execute Phase 3
3. Continue through remaining phases

## Blockers/Concerns

None currently. Phases 1-2 complete, ready to proceed.

## Notes

- Architecture: Skill + subagent pattern (no MCP server)
- Voices: Mystic (witchy) and Grounded (practical) - to be implemented in Phase 3
- Future: x402 micropayments for paid readings (v2)
- Skill pattern established: frontmatter + shell injection + forked context
