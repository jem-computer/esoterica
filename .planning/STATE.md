## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v1.0 validated decisions carry forward (with Phase 6 modification):
- ~~Skill + subagent pattern (context fork for isolation)~~ → Main context execution (Phase 6: required for AskUserQuestion)
- Shell injection for randomness (bash shuf)
- Config file precedence: .tarot > ~/.claude/tarot/config (removed inline --voice flag in Phase 6)

**Phase 6 decisions:**
- Interactive wizard replaces inline argument parsing
- AskUserQuestion requires main context (removed context fork)
- Voice selection remains config-based (not collected in wizard)
- Progressive implementation: Phase 6 collects Spread/Mode but doesn't implement logic yet

### Pending Todos

- [ ] Add a v1 README to the repo
- [ ] Write a snappy tagline for the project / for the github repo
- [ ] Make an MVP landing page

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Starting fresh milestone.
