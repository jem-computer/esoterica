# State: Esoterica

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-22)

**Core value:** Agents can draw and interpret tarot cards as a perspective-shifting tool
**Current focus:** v1.1 Wizard UI - Complete

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1 Wizard UI
Phase: 9 of 9 (Multi-Card Interpretation)
Plan: 1 of 1 complete
Status: Milestone complete
Last activity: 2026-01-23 - Completed 09-01-PLAN.md

Progress: v1.1 [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10 (5 v1.0 + 5 v1.1)
- Average duration (v1.1): 2.4 min
- Total execution time (v1.1): 12 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| v1.0 Phases 1-5 | 5 | - | - |
| Phase 6 (Wizard Infrastructure) | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |
| Phase 7 (Spread Options) | 2 | 4 min | 2 min |
| Phase 8 (Reading Modes) | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |
| Phase 9 (Multi-Card Interpretation) | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v1.0 validated decisions carry forward (with Phase 6 modification):
- ~~Skill + subagent pattern (context fork for isolation)~~ → Main context execution (Phase 6: required for AskUserQuestion)
- Shell injection for randomness (bash shuf)
- Config file precedence: .tarot > ~/.claude/tarot/config (removed inline --voice flag in Phase 6)

**Phase 6 decisions:**
- Interactive wizard replaces inline argument parsing
- AskUserQuestion requires main context (removed context fork)
- Voice selection remains config-based (not collected in wizard)
- Progressive implementation: Phase 6 collects Spread/Mode but doesn't implement logic yet

**Phase 7 decisions:**
- Situation/Action/Outcome positions chosen over Past/Present/Future
- Position preview shown before drawing cards (all spread types)
- Multi-card readings emphasize card weaving (one story, not separate interpretations)
- LLM-suggested generates exactly 3 contextual positions with approval flow
- Custom spread accepts 1-5 positions with comma-separated input
- Position-specific interpretation guidance (lean into LLM specificity, honor custom names)

**Phase 8 decisions:**
- Physical mode includes ritual moment before card entry (honors practice, creates intentional pause)
- Fuzzy matching supports card names, variants, and numbers (forgiving UX)
- Duplicate prevention in multi-card spreads (follows tarot convention)
- Summary confirmation for multi-card physical readings (user confidence before interpretation)

**Phase 9 decisions:**
- Multi-card uses woven narrative, single-card preserves v1.0 format (format distinction based on card count)
- Position names woven into prose as interpretive prompts, not section headers
- Card relationships explicitly called out (tensions/harmonies/imagery references)
- Closing questions must reference multiple cards/positions from reading (no generic "What resonates?")

### Pending Todos

- [ ] Add a v1 README to the repo
- [ ] Write a snappy tagline for the project / for the github repo
- [ ] Make an MVP landing page
- [ ] Let users save readings to file (see .planning/todos/pending/)

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Starting fresh milestone.

## Session Continuity

Resume file: None

## Next Steps

1. v1.1 milestone complete - all 4 phases delivered
2. Run `/gsd:audit-milestone` to verify requirements coverage
3. Or `/gsd:complete-milestone` to archive and prepare for v1.2
