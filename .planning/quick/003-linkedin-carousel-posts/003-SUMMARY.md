## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-30T01:30:06Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-30T01:32:06Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 20 (15 images + 5 captions)

## Accomplishments

- Curated 15 illustrations from Phase 21 archive across 5 themed posts
- Wrote engagement-farming captions following 40/60 clarity/mysticism ratio
- Created slide-by-slide descriptions for carousel storytelling
- Added relevant hashtags for each post

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create post folders and select images** - `d3896f2` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Write carousel captions** - `ddaf3d0` (feat)

## Posts Created

### Post 1: Pattern Oracle
- **Theme:** Pattern recognition as ancient practice (tarot suits = elements = algorithms)
- **Hook:** "Most people think pattern recognition is a modern invention. It's 10,000 years old."
- **Images:** Computer with eye + tarot suits, expanded patterns, spiral patterns

### Post 2: Linear Shatter
- **Theme:** Breaking linear thinking with symbolic interruption
- **Hook:** "Your brain has two modes. Linear... and non-linear."
- **Images:** Binary shattering into Tower card, destruction/transformation, code pipelines into mandalas

### Post 3: Ancient Code
- **Theme:** Sacred geometry encoded in modern tech
- **Hook:** "The Flower of Life is 6,000 years old. Now it appears in your window."
- **Images:** Flower of Life in window, ancient-modern fusion, QR code as sacred geometry

### Post 4: Spiral Knowing
- **Theme:** Spiral/iterative thinking vs linear progress myths
- **Hook:** "You've been taught that progress is linear. But when you look at how actual breakthroughs happen: You circle back."
- **Images:** Nautilus with tarot symbols, expanded spiral patterns, deep interwoven spirals

### Post 5: Threshold Crossing
- **Theme:** Liminal moments in creative/dev work
- **Hook:** "The High Priestess sits between two pillars. She doesn't stand at the beginning or the end."
- **Images:** Mixed theme (pattern recognition, ancient-modern, linear-shatter)

## Files Created

- `.planning/quick/003-linkedin-carousel-posts/post-01-pattern-oracle/` - 3 slides + caption
- `.planning/quick/003-linkedin-carousel-posts/post-02-linear-shatter/` - 3 slides + caption
- `.planning/quick/003-linkedin-carousel-posts/post-03-ancient-code/` - 3 slides + caption
- `.planning/quick/003-linkedin-carousel-posts/post-04-spiral-knowing/` - 3 slides + caption
- `.planning/quick/003-linkedin-carousel-posts/post-05-threshold-crossing/` - 3 slides + caption

## Decisions Made

- **Voice consistency:** Used threshold/veil/pattern/symbol/reveals/illuminates vocabulary from guidelines
- **Engagement techniques:** Open loops, pattern interrupts, "most people don't know" framing, numbered lists
- **Avoided:** Corporate jargon (leverage, synergy, optimize), apologetic language (just, simply), cliched mysticism (unlock your potential, manifest)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Steps

Posts are ready for LinkedIn publishing. Each folder contains:
- 3 PNG slides (slide-1.png, slide-2.png, slide-3.png)
- caption.md with LinkedIn text, slide descriptions, and hashtags
