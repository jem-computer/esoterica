# Esoterica

## What This Is

A framework for Claude Code agents to use tarot (and eventually other esoteric tools) in their reasoning process. Features an interactive wizard interface for selecting spread types and reading modes, with support for both digital random draws and physical deck entry.

## Core Value

Agents can draw and interpret tarot cards as a perspective-shifting tool for problem-solving, planning, and self-mythologizing.

### Out of Scope

- Runes, numerology, astrology — future esoteric tools
- MCP server — skill pattern validated and working well
- Custom user-defined reader personas — two voices sufficient
- Reversed card meanings — upright only for v1.3, revisit later
- Voice selection in wizard — config-based works well
- Save readings to file — deferred to v1.4

## Context

**Claude Code ecosystem:** Skills are prompt expansions invoked via `/command`. AskUserQuestion enables interactive wizard flows in main context.

**Use cases:**
- Problem-solving: stuck on architecture? Draw The Tower, see destruction/rebuilding lens
- Planning: starting a new phase? Draw to set intention/framing
- Self-mythologizing: Claude narrating its own journey through archetypal language
- Divinatory: "what energy does this codebase need?" style reflection
- Brand positioning: the tool eating its own tail (used /tarot to explore branding)

## Constraints

- **Architecture**: Skill pattern (no MCP server needed)
- **Platform**: Claude Code CLI — must work with current skill mechanisms
- **Scope**: Tarot (Major + Minor Arcana); framework allows future esoteric tools

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Skill pattern over MCP | No external data/APIs needed; simpler architecture | ✓ Good — single file, portable |
| Major Arcana only | 22 cards is tractable; full 78 adds complexity without core value | ✓ Good — rich enough |
| Two voices (Mystic/Grounded) | Accommodates different user preferences | ✓ Good — covers spectrum |
| Global config for voice | Set once, less friction per invocation | ✓ Good — three-tier precedence |
| Embedded card data | All card knowledge in SKILL.md, no external files | ✓ Good — portable |
| Voice as lens not persona | Both voices interpret same cards, just frame differently | ✓ Good — maintains competence |
| Grounded as default | Less alienating for skeptics | ✓ Good — welcoming entry |
| Interactive wizard (v1.1) | AskUserQuestion replaces inline args | ✓ Good — better UX |
| Main context execution (v1.1) | Required for AskUserQuestion | ✓ Good — enables interactivity |
| Situation/Action/Outcome (v1.1) | Chosen over Past/Present/Future for three-card | ✓ Good — more actionable |
| Position preview (v1.1) | Show positions before drawing cards | ✓ Good — user confidence |
| Physical mode ritual (v1.1) | Ritual moment before card entry | ✓ Good — honors practice |
| Woven narratives (v1.1) | Multi-card as one story, not separate readings | ✓ Good — cohesive interpretation |
| Position-weaving (v1.1) | Positions as interpretive prompts in prose | ✓ Good — natural flow |
| Lazy loading (v1.3) | Card data in separate files, loaded after draw | ✓ Good — context efficient |
| Suit-based numbering (v1.3) | Wands 22-35, Cups 36-49, Swords 50-63, Pentacles 64-77 | ✓ Good — clear structure |
| Major-only default (v1.3) | Backwards compatible deck selection | ✓ Good — preserves behavior |
| Optional "of" (v1.3) | "three cups" = "three of cups" | ✓ Good — natural input |

## Pending Todos

- [ ] Let users save readings to file (v1.4 candidate)
- [ ] Argument parsing cleanup
- [x] Card data separation from SKILL.md — v1.3
