# Milestone v1.1: Wizard UI

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-23
**Phases:** 6-9
**Total Plans:** 5

## Overview

Replace inline args with interactive wizard flow using AskUserQuestion, add spread selection and physical reading mode.

## Phases

### Phase 6: Wizard Infrastructure

**Goal**: `/tarot` launches interactive wizard instead of accepting inline arguments
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (working skill infrastructure from v1.0)
**Requirements**: WIZ-01, WIZ-02, WIZ-03, WIZ-04
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Add AskUserQuestion wizard, remove context fork, update reading flow

**Success Criteria:**
1. Running `/tarot` opens a tabbed wizard interface (not inline args)
2. Tab 1 collects user's question or context for the reading
3. Tab 2 presents spread selection (options can be placeholder for now)
4. Tab 3 presents mode selection (options can be placeholder for now)
5. Completing wizard triggers reading flow with collected inputs

### Phase 7: Spread Options

**Goal**: Users can choose from four spread types when requesting a reading
**Depends on**: Phase 6 (wizard infrastructure)
**Requirements**: SPREAD-01, SPREAD-02, SPREAD-03, SPREAD-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Wizard options update, spread dispatch, three-card preset implementation
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — LLM-suggested and custom spread implementations

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can select single card spread (current behavior preserved)
2. User can select Situation/Action/Outcome 3-card spread
3. User can select "Claude suggests" and LLM generates contextual positions
4. User can select custom spread and type their own position names
5. Selected spread passes position names to card selection flow

### Phase 8: Reading Modes

**Goal**: Users can choose between digital (random) and physical (enter cards) modes
**Depends on**: Phase 6 (wizard infrastructure)
**Requirements**: MODE-01, MODE-02, MODE-03
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md - Card matching infrastructure, physical mode entry flow, mode dispatch

**Success Criteria:**
1. Digital mode performs random card selection (current shuf behavior)
2. Physical mode prompts user to enter cards they drew from real deck
3. Physical mode accepts card names ("The Tower") or numbers (16)
4. Both modes work with any spread type (1 card or multiple)

---

### Phase 9: Multi-Card Interpretation

**Goal**: Multi-card spreads produce woven narratives with position-aware interpretation
**Depends on**: Phase 7 (spreads), Phase 8 (modes)
**Requirements**: INTERP-01, INTERP-02, INTERP-03
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — Woven narrative format, position-weaving patterns, card relationships, voice examples

**Success Criteria:**
1. Single card interpretation works as before (regression check)
2. Multi-card readings connect meaning across positions (not just 3 separate interpretations)
3. Position names ("Problem", "Solution", "Synthesis") inform how each card is interpreted
4. LLM-suggested and custom position names work with interpretation engine

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Interactive wizard replaces inline argument parsing (AskUserQuestion)
- Removed context fork to enable AskUserQuestion (interactive tools require main context)
- Situation/Action/Outcome positions chosen over Past/Present/Future
- Position preview shown before drawing cards (all spread types)
- Physical mode includes ritual moment before card entry
- Fuzzy matching supports card names, variants, and numbers
- Multi-card uses woven narrative, single-card preserves v1.0 format
- Position names woven into prose as interpretive prompts, not section headers
- Closing questions must reference multiple cards/positions from reading

**Issues Resolved:**
- None - clean execution

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
