<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write LinkedIn teaser and announcement posts</name>
  <files>brand/launch/linkedin-posts.md</files>
  <action>
Create `brand/launch/` directory and write LinkedIn posts following these specifications:

**Teaser Post (post 1-3 days before announcement):**
- Hook in first 140 characters (mobile "see more" cutoff): Start with intrigue, e.g., "What if your AI agent could draw tarot cards for complex decisions?"
- Body: 800-1,000 chars teasing the problem/solution without full reveal
- CTA: "More coming [date]" or invitation to follow
- Tone: Cosmic priestess energy per voice-guidelines.md - mysterious but not confusing, confident without arrogance
- Use card language: "draw" not "select", "reading" not "session"

**Announcement Post (launch day):**
- Hook in first 140 chars: Direct value statement, e.g., "Esoterica is live. Tarot readings for Claude agents."
- Body (1,300-1,600 chars total):
  - What it is (1 sentence)
  - Why it matters (the perspective-shifting insight)
  - How to use it (`npm install -g esoterica`)
  - Where to learn more (landing page link)
- Include install command prominently
- End with clear CTA

**Format for both:**
```markdown
## Teaser Post

[Hook - first 140 chars marked]

[Full post body]

---
Character count: [X]
First 140 chars: [hook text]

## Announcement Post

[Hook - first 140 chars marked]

[Full post body]

---
Character count: [X]
First 140 chars: [hook text]
```

**Voice rules (from voice-guidelines.md):**
- DO use: threshold, veil, draw, reading, spread, illuminates, reveals
- DON'T use: leverage, synergy, optimize, solution, just, simply
- DON'T use cliched mysticism: unlock potential, manifest destiny, divine guidance
- 40% clarity / 60% mysticism for social media

Reference tagline: "Ancient patterns, new paths"
Reference messaging from positioning-statement.md: "perspective-shifting framework using tarot's archetypal patterns"

1. `cat brand/launch/linkedin-posts.md` shows both posts
2. Teaser post character count is 800-1,600 chars
3. Announcement post character count is 1,300-1,600 chars
4. First 140 chars of each post work as standalone hooks
5. Posts use "draw" not "select", "reading" not "session"
6. No corporate jargon (leverage, synergy, optimize)

  <done>Two LinkedIn posts written with correct character counts, hooks in first 140 chars, and cosmic priestess voice</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Complete OG meta tags with image dimensions</name>
  <files>docs/index.html</files>
  <action>
Update docs/index.html to add missing OG image dimension tags that prevent cropping issues on social platforms.

**Add these meta tags after existing og:image tag:**
```html
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630">
<meta property="og:image:type" content="image/png">
<meta property="og:image:alt" content="Sacred altar in Joshua Tree with tarot cards and crystal-computer displaying esoterica interface">
```

**Also add to Twitter section if missing:**
```html
<meta name="twitter:image:alt" content="Sacred altar in Joshua Tree with tarot cards and crystal-computer displaying esoterica interface">
```

**Update og:site_name if missing:**
```html
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Esoterica">
```

Keep all existing meta tags. Only add what's missing. The og:image URL is already correct (https://jem-computer.github.io/esoterica/og-image.png).

The image at docs/og-image.png is 1200x630px (verified by Phase 12 social asset generation).
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `grep -c "og:image:width" docs/index.html` returns 1
2. `grep -c "og:image:height" docs/index.html` returns 1
3. `grep -c "og:image:alt" docs/index.html` returns at least 1
4. Test at https://metatags.io/ after deployment (note in summary)
  </verify>
  <done>docs/index.html has complete OG meta tags including image dimensions and alt text</done>
