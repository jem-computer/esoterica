# Phase 11: Documentation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Create README that lets developers understand, install, and use Esoterica. Apply voice guidelines from Phase 10 positioning suite. Screenshots/visual assets are Phase 12 — this is text-first.

## Implementation Decisions

### README Structure
- **Opening:** Tagline ("Ancient patterns, new paths") + one-liner explanation
- **Sections (in order):**
  1. What is this — brief explanation of what Esoterica does
  2. Quick Start — installation + first reading in <2 min
  3. Usage examples — different spreads, voices, modes
  4. Why tarot? — philosophy section explaining the approach
- Visuals/screenshots to be added later (Phase 12 or after)

### Installation Flow
- Manual installation only for v1 (clone repo, add to Claude Code settings)
- npx support deferred to later (noted in todos)
- Keep prerequisites minimal — just Claude Code

### Voice Application
- Apply voice guidelines from `.planning/phases/10-positioning/brand/voice-guidelines.md`
- Mystic-leaning but clear about what the tool does
- Installation instructions have flavor (per voice guidelines examples)

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact wording of one-liner
- How much detail in Usage examples section
- Whether to include badges (build status, etc.)
- Code block formatting choices

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- User needs this shipped fast (before dinner, ~10 min)
- Text-first, visuals later — don't block on screenshots
- Use positioning suite as source material for voice and framing

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- npx installation support — captured in todos
- Screenshots/terminal recordings — Phase 12 (Visual Language)
- Interactive demo — Phase 13 (Landing Page)
