<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write README.md with Esoterica voice</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README.md in repository root with the following structure:

**Opening (tagline + one-liner):**
- Start with: "Ancient patterns, new paths."
- Follow with one-liner from positioning statement
- Keep opening evocative but clear on what this IS

**What is this section:**
- Brief explanation (2-3 paragraphs max)
- For developers: "symbolic reasoning tool, rubber duck with 78 archetypes"
- For practitioners: "tarot practice integrated into development workflow"
- Technical truth: 78 cards, 4 spreads, 2 voices, CLI-native

**Quick Start section:**
- Prerequisites: Claude Code only
- Installation: clone repo, add to Claude Code settings
- First reading: show the exact command to draw cards
- Keep it under 2 minutes to first reading

**Usage Examples section:**
- Different spreads: single, three-card, celtic-cross
- Different voices: mystic vs direct
- Show actual command examples with flavor text

**Why tarot? section:**
- Philosophy from positioning statement
- Not fortune-telling, archetypal mirrors
- We used the tool to position the tool (proof point)

**Voice requirements (from voice-guidelines.md):**
- 55% clarity, 45% mysticism ratio
- Use: "draw" not "select", "reading" not "session", "spread" not "layout"
- Avoid: corporate jargon, apologetic language, cliched mysticism
- Confident without arrogance

**DO NOT include:**
- Screenshots or images (Phase 12)
- npx installation (deferred)
- Badges (optional, skip for speed)
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists: `ls README.md`
- Contains tagline: `grep "Ancient patterns" README.md`
- Contains Quick Start section: `grep -i "quick start" README.md`
- Uses "draw" not "select": `grep -c "draw" README.md` should be > 0
- Avoids "select cards": `grep -c "select.*card" README.md` should be 0
- Line count adequate: `wc -l README.md` shows 80+ lines
  </verify>
  <done>
README.md exists with:
- Tagline opening ("Ancient patterns, new paths")
- Clear explanation of what Esoterica is
- Quick Start that enables first reading in <2 min
- Usage examples showing spreads and voices
- Philosophy section explaining the approach
- Voice that is mystic-leaning but clear
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After task completion, verify:
1. README.md renders correctly (view in GitHub or `cat README.md`)
2. Installation instructions actually work (manual clone + settings)
3. Command examples are accurate to current implementation
4. Voice consistency: no corporate jargon, uses tarot terminology
