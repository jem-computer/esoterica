<objective>
Create the card data files that will hold full card meanings, extracting Major Arcana from SKILL.md and creating placeholder files for Minor Arcana suits.

Purpose: Separate card data from orchestration logic, enabling lazy loading of card meanings after cards are drawn.
Output: Five card data files in skills/tarot/cards/ directory.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extract Major Arcana to dedicated file</name>
  <files>skills/tarot/cards/major-arcana.md</files>
  <action>
Create the cards/ directory and major-arcana.md file by extracting all 22 Major Arcana card definitions from SKILL.md.

File structure:
```markdown
# Major Arcana

Full card meanings for interpretation. Load this file after drawing Major Arcana cards.

## Card 0: The Fool

**Themes:** [from SKILL.md]
**Situations:** [from SKILL.md]
**Shadows:** [from SKILL.md]
**Symbols:** [from SKILL.md]

---

## Card 1: The Magician
[...]
```

Extract the entire "Major Arcana Meanings" section (Cards 0-21) from SKILL.md lines ~381-513. Each card keeps its exact content - Themes, Situations, Shadows, Symbols. Add horizontal rule (---) between cards for visual separation.

Header includes loading instruction for Claude: "Load this file after drawing Major Arcana cards."

Do NOT modify SKILL.md in this task - that happens in Plan 02.
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists at skills/tarot/cards/major-arcana.md
- Contains all 22 cards (0-21)
- Grep confirms: `grep -c "^## Card" skills/tarot/cards/major-arcana.md` returns 22
- Each card has Themes, Situations, Shadows, Symbols sections
  </verify>
  <done>
- major-arcana.md contains all 22 Major Arcana cards with full meanings
- Format uses "## Card N: Name" headings for easy lookup
- Content matches SKILL.md exactly (no interpretation changes)
  </done>

  <action>
Create four placeholder files for Minor Arcana suits. These will be populated in Phase 17.

Each file follows the same template:
```markdown
# [Suit Name]

Full card meanings for interpretation. Load this file after drawing [Suit Name] cards.

**Element:** [Fire for Wands, Water for Cups, Air for Swords, Earth for Pentacles]
**Domain:** [Will/Action for Wands, Emotion/Relationships for Cups, Intellect/Conflict for Swords, Material/Practical for Pentacles]

## Cards

Cards will be added in Phase 17 (Minor Arcana Content).

- Ace through 10 (pip cards)
- Page, Knight, Queen, King (court cards)
```

Elemental associations (from ROADMAP.md success criteria):
- Wands: Fire, Will/Action
- Cups: Water, Emotion/Relationships
- Swords: Air, Intellect/Conflict
- Pentacles: Earth, Material/Practical

These placeholders establish the file structure and document the element associations that Phase 17 will use.
  </action>
  <verify>
- All four files exist in skills/tarot/cards/
- Each file has correct element and domain
- `ls skills/tarot/cards/` shows 5 files total (major-arcana.md + 4 suits)
  </verify>
  <done>
- wands.md, cups.md, swords.md, pentacles.md exist
- Each placeholder documents element and domain
- Structure ready for Phase 17 content
  </done>
</task>

After both tasks complete:
1. Directory structure: `ls -la skills/tarot/cards/` shows 5 .md files
2. Major Arcana complete: `grep -c "^## Card" skills/tarot/cards/major-arcana.md` returns 22
3. All suits present: `ls skills/tarot/cards/*.md | wc -l` returns 5
4. No SKILL.md changes yet (verify line count unchanged from ~843 lines)

<success_criteria>
- [ ] skills/tarot/cards/ directory created
- [ ] major-arcana.md contains all 22 cards with full Themes/Situations/Shadows/Symbols
- [ ] Four Minor Arcana placeholder files exist with element/domain documented
- [ ] File format supports Claude's Read tool lookup pattern
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/16-architecture-refactor/16-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
