<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Expand SKILL.md with complete Major Arcana meanings</name>
  <files>skills/tarot/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Replace the simple card list in SKILL.md with rich card meanings for all 22 Major Arcana.

For each card (0-21), include:
- **Core themes** — 2-3 central meanings (e.g., The Fool = new beginnings, innocent faith, leap into unknown)
- **Life situations** — When this card applies (starting projects, facing uncertainty, making leaps)
- **Shadow aspects** — Challenges or warnings (recklessness, naivete, ignoring risks)
- **Symbolic imagery** — Key symbols and meanings (cliff edge, white rose, small dog companion)

Structure as:
```
## Card 0: The Fool
**Themes:** New beginnings, innocent faith, the leap
**Situations:** Starting something new, stepping into unknown, trusting the journey
**Shadows:** Recklessness, naivety, ignoring practical concerns
**Symbols:** Cliff edge (threshold), white rose (purity), dog (instinct/companion), bundle (all you need)
```

Also update the interpretation instructions to:
1. Direct the subagent to BE the tarot reader (interpret FOR the user)
2. Connect card themes explicitly to user's context/question
3. Reference specific card sections when interpreting
4. Handle both "question provided" and "no question" cases

The subagent should feel like a tarot reader giving a reading, not a database lookup.

Keep the existing frontmatter (name, description, context: fork, etc.) and shell injection for card selection.

  <name>Task 2: Verify contextual tarot reading works</name>
  <what-built>Complete Major Arcana with rich meanings and contextual interpretation</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `/tarot` in Claude Code
2. Observe that the reading:
   - Names the drawn card correctly
   - References specific themes/symbols from the card
   - Connects to your current context or session
   - Feels like an interpretation, not a card definition
3. Optionally run `/tarot what should I consider about [some topic]` to verify question handling
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if readings are rich and contextual, or describe issues</resume-signal>
</task>

Phase 2 requirements verification:

- CARD-01 (Major Arcana deck with meanings): All 22 cards have themes, situations, shadows, symbols
- CARD-02 (Upright meanings): Each card has upright interpretation content
- CARD-03 (Embedded in prompt): Card data is in SKILL.md, not external files

Manual check: Run `/tarot` multiple times to verify different cards produce appropriate interpretations

<success_criteria>
- [ ] SKILL.md contains 22 card definitions with 4 sections each
- [ ] Subagent provides contextual interpretations, not lookups
- [ ] Readings connect card themes to user's situation
- [ ] Human verification confirms quality of readings
