# Tagline Options for Esoterica

## Spectrum Overview

From the CONTEXT.md decisions, the tagline should:
- Evoke both **intrigue AND clarity** — intriguing but not confusing
- **Abstract the concept** — "perspective-shifting tools" rather than "tarot"
- **Imply tech context** without explicitly saying "AI agents"
- Use a **poetic/evocative tone register**
- Include **mystery/threshold energy** (High Priestess influence)
- Work **paired with product name**, not standalone

The spectrum below ranges from clarity-leaning (utility-forward, mystery subtle) to intrigue-leaning (evocative-forward, context-dependent).

## Clarity-Leaning Options (70/30 utility:mystery)

### 1. "Shift your perspective"
- **Card theme:** Chariot (direction, momentum, new trajectory)
- **Clarity-intrigue ratio:** 75/25
- **Why it works:** Direct action-oriented promise. Developers understand immediately this is a thinking tool. The word "shift" has movement energy without being mystical.
- **Potential concerns:** Almost too generic — could apply to many products. Needs the product context to land.

### 2. "Tools for thinking sideways"
- **Card theme:** Justice (balance between logical and lateral thinking)
- **Clarity-intrigue ratio:** 70/30
- **Why it works:** "Tools" signals utility, "sideways" signals unconventional approach. Implies problem-solving without prescribing how.
- **Potential concerns:** "Sideways" might feel too casual for some audiences. Could read as quirky rather than profound.

### 3. "New angles on old problems"
- **Card theme:** Justice (rebalancing perspective)
- **Clarity-intrigue ratio:** 70/30
- **Why it works:** Clear value proposition. Implies both novelty and utility. "Old problems" resonates with developers stuck in loops.
- **Potential concerns:** Slightly long (5 words). "Angles" metaphor is common in business speak.

## Balanced Options (50/50 clarity:intrigue)

### 4. "Draw a different path"
- **Card theme:** Chariot + High Priestess (direction through intuition)
- **Clarity-intrigue ratio:** 50/50
- **Why it works:** "Draw" has double meaning (pull cards, sketch paths). "Different" implies alternative thinking. Poetic but actionable.
- **Potential concerns:** The pun might feel too clever. Works best when paired with card imagery.

### 5. "When logic needs a mirror"
- **Card theme:** High Priestess (reflection, inner knowing)
- **Clarity-intrigue ratio:** 45/55
- **Why it works:** Acknowledges the developer's logical mindset while offering something complementary. "Mirror" suggests self-reflection without mysticism.
- **Potential concerns:** Slightly abstract. Requires a moment to parse. The "when" construction implies conditional use.

### 6. "Beyond the algorithm"
- **Card theme:** High Priestess (threshold, hidden knowledge)
- **Clarity-intrigue ratio:** 50/50
- **Why it works:** Directly speaks to tech audience. "Beyond" has threshold energy. Suggests something algorithms can't reach.
- **Potential concerns:** Could sound critical of tech rather than complementary. Might attract skeptics rather than practitioners.

### 7. "Pause. Shuffle. See."
- **Card theme:** Justice + High Priestess (deliberation, intuition, clarity)
- **Clarity-intrigue ratio:** 50/50
- **Why it works:** Three-beat rhythm is memorable. Implies process without prescribing it. "Shuffle" hints at cards without saying tarot. "See" is revelatory.
- **Potential concerns:** Might feel too poetic for some developers. The periods create rhythm but also fragmentation.

## Intrigue-Leaning Options (30/70 clarity:intrigue)

### 8. "The card you needed to draw"
- **Card theme:** High Priestess (fate, synchronicity, hidden knowing)
- **Clarity-intrigue ratio:** 30/70
- **Why it works:** Mystical energy, implies destiny/synchronicity. Creates curiosity. Has a "you needed this" resonance that practitioners recognize.
- **Potential concerns:** Very intrigue-forward — might confuse developers unfamiliar with tarot. Needs strong context from product description.

### 9. "Where patterns speak"
- **Card theme:** High Priestess (symbols, interpretation, meaning-making)
- **Clarity-intrigue ratio:** 35/65
- **Why it works:** "Patterns" resonates with developers (code patterns) and practitioners (archetypal patterns). "Speak" implies revelation without claiming prophecy.
- **Potential concerns:** Abstract. Could be interpreted many ways. Needs product context to land.

### 10. "The threshold before the answer"
- **Card theme:** High Priestess (veil, liminal space, before/after)
- **Clarity-intrigue ratio:** 25/75
- **Why it works:** Pure High Priestess energy. Positions the tool as a doorway, not a destination. "Threshold" is powerful liminal language.
- **Potential concerns:** Most abstract option. Practitioners will love it; developers might not get it without context.

## Not Included (Filtered Out)

The following were considered but rejected per CONTEXT.md constraints:

- "Tarot for developers" — too literal, says tarot explicitly
- "AI-powered readings" — too explicit about AI, sounds like SaaS marketing
- "Unlock your intuition" — clichéd mysticism
- "The wisdom you seek" — generic, applies to everything
- "Digital divination" — too cute, sounds like a product category not a benefit
- "Cards for code" — clever but confusing, sounds like documentation
