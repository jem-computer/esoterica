# Phase 17: Minor Arcana Content - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

All 56 Minor Arcana cards with full interpretive depth — 14 cards each for Wands, Cups, Swords, Pentacles. Each card gets complete meanings. Wizard integration and deck selection are Phase 18.

## Implementation Decisions

### Interpretive Depth
- Same structure as Major Arcana: Themes, Situations, Shadows, Symbols for every card
- 3-4 concrete situations per card (e.g., "Starting a business," not just "New beginnings")
- No shortcuts for "lesser" cards — full depth across all 56

### Pip Card Progression (Ace-10)
- Follow journey progression narrative within each suit
- Ace = seed/potential, 2-9 = development stages, 10 = completion/culmination
- Each number tells part of the suit's story arc

### Court Cards (Page/Knight/Queen/King)
- Standard structure only — no separate "As a person" section
- Themes/Situations/Shadows/Symbols like other cards
- Personality interpretation embedded in Themes rather than called out separately

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact wording and phrasing
- How to express elemental associations within card meanings
- Symbol choices that resonate with each card's energy

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Maintain consistency with existing Major Arcana voice and style
- Card format matches Phase 16 structure: "## Card [number/name]" with Themes/Situations/Shadows/Symbols
- Elemental associations already documented in placeholder files (Wands=Fire, Cups=Water, Swords=Air, Pentacles=Earth)
