<objective>
Implement two distinct interpretive voices (Mystic and Grounded) for tarot readings.

Purpose: Enable dramatically different reading experiences while maintaining technical competence in both voices. The user's Phase 4 configuration will select which voice to use; this phase implements the voices themselves.

Output: Updated SKILL.md with voice definitions, few-shot examples, and voice consistency instructions.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add voice system to SKILL.md</name>
  <files>skills/tarot/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Update SKILL.md to add the complete voice system. Insert after the "## Major Arcana Meanings" section and before the "## Reading Instructions" section.

**Replace the current "## Voice Options" placeholder section with:**

1. **Voice System section** (`<voice_system>` block):
   - Introduction explaining two voices available
   - `<mystic_voice>` block with:
     - Archetype: Techno-mystic cosmic priestess, divine feminine, futuristic ecotopian, Unity Consciousness
     - Language patterns: Hybrid cosmic-earth vocabulary ("galaxy spirals like water, stars seed the soil of becoming")
     - Rhythm: Mix flowing poetic passages with oracular declarations
     - Pronouns: "we/one" not "you" ("we who seek", "one who draws this card")
     - Technical framing: Cosmic lens without sacrificing technical accuracy
     - Opening/closing bookend examples (subtle, 1-2 sentences max)
   - `<grounded_voice>` block with:
     - Archetype: Pragmatic advisor, no-nonsense, cuts to practical insight
     - Language: Very direct sentences ("This card means X. For you, consider Y.")
     - Pronouns: Direct "you"
     - Technical specificity: Explicitly name patterns/concepts
     - Opening/closing bookend examples

2. **Voice Examples section** (`<voice_examples>` block):
   - Pick ONE card (The Tower is ideal - shows technical integration well)
   - Provide full interpretation in Mystic voice (~150 words)
   - Provide full interpretation in Grounded voice (~150 words)
   - Both examples should reference the SAME hypothetical technical context (authentication refactor) to show how both voices handle technical topics

3. **Voice Consistency section** (`<voice_consistency>` block):
   - Explicit instruction to maintain voice from opening to closing
   - DO NOT slip into generic AI assistant tone
   - DO NOT abandon voice when discussing technical topics
   - DO NOT mix voices within a single reading
   - Examples of wrong vs right for both voices
   - "The voice is how you see, not what you see"

4. **Phase 4 Placeholder**:
   - Comment indicating where voice selection mechanism will be added
   - For now, note that voice may be passed via arguments or defaults to Grounded

5. **Update Reading Instructions**:
   - Add step: "Select and maintain your voice throughout the reading"
   - Reference that voice applies to ALL content including technical discussion
   - Note that both voices draw from the same card meanings, just frame differently

**Key patterns from RESEARCH.md to follow:**
- Use XML tags for organization (`<mystic_voice>`, `<grounded_voice>`, etc.)
- Few-shot examples are critical for voice consistency
- Explicit "do NOT" instructions prevent generic AI slop
- Mystic: Balance metaphor AND technical truth
- Grounded: Name specific technical patterns, then connect to card

**Avoid these anti-patterns:**
- Heavy-handed persona without substance (Mystic should have depth, not purple prose)
- Abandoning voice for technical topics (both voices maintain character)
- Overly complex conditional logic (keep simple, Phase 4 adds selection)
- Cliched mystical phrases ("journey", "exciting", etc.)
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify SKILL.md contains:
- `<voice_system>` section with both voice definitions
- `<voice_examples>` with Tower card in both voices
- `<voice_consistency>` with explicit maintenance instructions
- Updated Reading Instructions referencing voice selection
- Comment placeholder for Phase 4 voice selection mechanism

Run: `grep -c "mystic_voice\|grounded_voice\|voice_examples\|voice_consistency" skills/tarot/SKILL.md` should return 4+ matches
  </verify>
  <done>
SKILL.md contains complete voice system: two distinct voice definitions, few-shot examples, and consistency instructions. Voice system ready for Phase 4 configuration integration.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Verify voices sound distinct</name>
  <what-built>
Complete voice system with Mystic (techno-mystic cosmic priestess) and Grounded (pragmatic advisor) voices, including examples and consistency instructions.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `/tarot` twice in Claude Code
2. First reading: Mentally note the tone
3. Second reading: Compare - does it feel like the same voice?
4. Check: Do readings sound dramatically different when Mystic vs Grounded patterns are used?
5. If a technical context was available, did the voice maintain character while discussing code?

**Note:** Until Phase 4 configuration exists, you may need to manually instruct "use Mystic voice" or "use Grounded voice" in your tarot prompt, or the skill may default to one voice.

**Success looks like:**
- Mystic: Cosmic-earth metaphors, "we/one" pronouns, flowing poetic rhythm, technical insight through cosmic lens
- Grounded: Direct "you", actionable sentences, specific technical references if relevant

**Failure looks like:**
- Both readings sound similar (generic AI tone)
- Technical topics cause voice to drop away
- Mystic is flowery but vague
- Grounded dismisses archetypal depth
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if voices sound distinct, or describe issues for revision</resume-signal>

After task completion:
- [ ] SKILL.md has voice system section with XML-tagged voice definitions
- [ ] Both Mystic and Grounded voices are fully defined with archetypes, language patterns, and examples
- [ ] Few-shot examples show both voices interpreting the same card
- [ ] Voice consistency instructions prevent drift and maintain character for technical topics
- [ ] Reading instructions updated to reference voice selection
- [ ] Human verification confirms voices sound dramatically different
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Same card interpreted with Mystic voice sounds dramatically different than Grounded
- Neither voice loses ability to discuss technical topics
- Voice is tone/framing, not persona change
- Requirements VOICE-01, VOICE-02, VOICE-03 satisfied
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-voice-system/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
