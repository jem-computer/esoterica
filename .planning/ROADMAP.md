### v1.4 Website Upgrade

**Milestone Goal:** Transform the landing page from static hero image to an immersive scroll-driven video experience with Gateway Process illustrations and proper site footer.

- [x] **Phase 19: Scroll Video** - Scroll-driven video hero with `<video>` element currentTime mapping
- [x] **Phase 20: Mobile + Accessibility** - Mobile fallback, reduced-motion support, scroll hint
- [ ] **Phase 21: Gateway Illustrations** - Illustration prompts, integration, hybrid layout
- [ ] **Phase 22: Footer + Polish** - Site footer, loading states, Lighthouse audit

## Phase Details

### Phase 19: Scroll Video
**Goal**: Visitors experience Apple-style scroll-driven video playback tied to scroll position
**Depends on**: Phase 18 (existing Astro site from quick-002 migration)
**Requirements**: WEB-01, WEB-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Scrolling the hero section plays the video forward; scrolling back plays it in reverse
  2. First frame displays immediately as poster state before any scrolling
  3. Video is a `<video>` element with currentTime driven by scroll position
  4. Source video is compressed from 25MB to under 5MB
  5. Page loads without jank -- scroll handler uses requestAnimationFrame throttling
**Plans:** 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 19-01-PLAN.md -- Compress source video with ffmpeg for web delivery
- [x] 19-02-PLAN.md -- Build scroll-driven video hero component and integrate

### Phase 20: Mobile + Accessibility
**Goal**: The scroll video works gracefully on mobile devices and respects accessibility preferences
**Depends on**: Phase 19
**Requirements**: (extends WEB-01 -- mobile and a11y dimensions)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Mobile visitors see a static poster or reduced frame set instead of full 240-frame sequence
  2. Users with `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled see a static frame with no scroll animation
  3. A scroll hint chevron communicates that the hero section is interactive
  4. Text overlay fades in sync with scroll progress
  5. Canvas resizes correctly when viewport dimensions change
**Plans:** 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 20-01-PLAN.md -- Reduced-motion support, poster extraction, viewport resize handling
- [x] 20-02-PLAN.md -- Scroll hint element with delayed appearance and scroll fade

### Phase 21: Gateway Illustrations
**Goal**: The landing page features Gateway Process-style illustrations that explain Esoterica's concepts
**Depends on**: Phase 18 (independent of video phases; can run after 19-20 or in parallel)
**Requirements**: WEB-03, WEB-04, WEB-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Illustration prompts are generated and ready for Nano Banana Pro image creation
  2. Illustrations appear on the landing page interspersed with prose and/or in a 3-column grid
  3. Illustrations are theme-aware (adapt to dark/light mode via CSS custom properties)
  4. Illustrations fade in on scroll using Intersection Observer
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 22: Footer + Polish
**Goal**: The site has a complete footer and passes quality benchmarks
**Depends on**: Phases 19, 20, 21
**Requirements**: WEB-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Footer displays "(c) 02026-, Temple of Silicon" linking to templeofsilicon.com and GitHub icon linking to the repo
  2. Loading states show poster frame while video frames load
  3. Site scores 90+ on Lighthouse performance audit
  4. Site renders correctly in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge
**Plans**: TBD
