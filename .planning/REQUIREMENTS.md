# Requirements: Esoterica v1.2

**Defined:** 2026-01-23
**Core Value:** Agents can draw and interpret tarot cards as a perspective-shifting tool for problem-solving, planning, and self-mythologizing.

## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for Brand & Marketing milestone.

### Documentation

- [ ] **DOC-01**: README with value proposition, installation, usage examples
- [ ] **DOC-02**: Voice/tone that reflects the tool (not dry technical docs)
- [ ] **DOC-03**: Screenshots or examples showing wizard flow

### Positioning

- [ ] **POS-01**: One-line tagline/pitch
- [ ] **POS-02**: Positioning that honors tarot reading (Justice, High Priestess, Chariot)
- [ ] **POS-03**: Dual-audience framing (curious devs AND serious practitioners)

### Landing Page

- [ ] **LAND-01**: Public URL with basic info (what it is, how to get it)
- [ ] **LAND-02**: Interactive demo or sample reading
- [ ] **LAND-03**: Visual design matching mystical-but-grounded tone

### Visual Assets

- [ ] **VIS-01**: Hero image from AI Design Machine (Joshua Tree style)
- [ ] **VIS-02**: AI Design Machine integration (API or manual checkpoint)
- [ ] **VIS-03**: Visual language documentation (for consistency)

### Launch Comms

- [ ] **LAUNCH-01**: LinkedIn posts (teaser + launch announcement)
- [ ] **LAUNCH-02**: LinkedIn imagery from AI Design Machine
- [ ] **LAUNCH-03**: Open graph images for link sharing
- [ ] **LAUNCH-04**: Demo GIF/video showing wizard flow

## Implementation Notes

Context for phase planning:

- **Terminal mockups**: Can be generated as styled React components (no manual screenshots)
- **Interactive demo**: asciinema or React terminal emulator for landing page
- **Video assets**: Remotion for programmatic video generation
- **AI Design Machine**: Integration method TBD (API, bridge, or manual checkpoint)
- **Visual language**: Joshua Tree style — retro-futuristic tech in natural settings, flowing black/white garments, golden hour, tech-nature fusion

## Positioning Context

Tarot reading for "How should we brand/position this project?":
- **Core Identity (Justice)**: Serious tool for balance and clarity, not a novelty
- **Audience Perception (High Priestess)**: Mystery, hidden knowledge, threshold between conventional and something-more
- **Differentiator (Chariot)**: Focused forward motion, opposites harnessed, actually goes somewhere

Open question: "What's the one-line pitch that captures Justice's balance and The High Priestess's mystique—without losing The Chariot's sense that this goes somewhere?"

## Future Requirements

Deferred to later milestones:

- Minor Arcana expansion (56 cards)
- Save readings to file
- Argument parsing cleanup
- Card data separation from SKILL.md
- Subagent exploration
- GSD workflow integration

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Full marketing campaign | This is MVP launch presence, not sustained marketing |
| Paid advertising | Organic launch first |
| Multiple language support | English only for v1.2 |
| Mobile app | Web landing page sufficient |
