# Requirements: Esoterica

**Defined:** 2025-01-21
**Core Value:** Agents can draw and interpret tarot cards as a perspective-shifting tool for problem-solving, planning, and self-mythologizing.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Skill Infrastructure

- [ ] **SKILL-01**: `/tarot` skill invokes tarot reading flow
- [ ] **SKILL-02**: Skill spawns tarot-reader subagent for interpretation
- [ ] **SKILL-03**: Skill handles random card selection (bash shuf or similar)

### Card System

- [ ] **CARD-01**: Major Arcana deck (22 cards) with meanings and symbolism
- [ ] **CARD-02**: Each card has upright meaning (reversed out of scope for MVP)
- [ ] **CARD-03**: Card data embedded in subagent prompt for portability

### Voice System

- [ ] **VOICE-01**: Mystic voice available (witchy, evocative, archetypal language)
- [ ] **VOICE-02**: Grounded voice available (practical, direct archetypal interpretation)
- [ ] **VOICE-03**: Voice is interpretive lens, not persona change (maintains technical competence)

### Configuration

- [ ] **CONFIG-01**: Global voice preference setting (set once, used always)
- [ ] **CONFIG-02**: Config stored in ~/.claude/ or project-level location

### Invocation

- [ ] **INVOKE-01**: User can invoke reading via `/tarot` command
- [ ] **INVOKE-02**: Claude can invoke reading programmatically when stuck/exploring

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Extended Readings

- **READ-01**: Quick draw mode (card + brief insight)
- **READ-02**: Deep reading mode (full interpretation with context)
- **READ-03**: Multi-card spreads (3-card past/present/future)

### Extended Deck

- **DECK-01**: Minor Arcana (56 additional cards)
- **DECK-02**: Reversed card meanings
- **DECK-03**: Card-to-card relationship interpretations

### Other Esoteric Tools

- **ESOT-01**: Runes system
- **ESOT-02**: Numerology system
- **ESOT-03**: Astrology system

### Monetization

- **PAY-01**: x402 micropayments integration for paid readings
- **PAY-02**: Agent-to-agent payment flow (other agents pay for readings)

### Advanced Configuration

- **ADV-01**: Custom user-defined reader personas
- **ADV-02**: Per-project voice overrides

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| MCP server | Overkill for static data; skill + subagent is simpler |
| Minor Arcana (56 cards) | 22 Major Arcana is tractable; full 78 adds complexity without core value |
| Reversed card meanings | Start with upright only; adds complexity |
| External card data files | Embedded in prompt is more portable |
| Multiple simultaneous voices | Pick one, use it; reduces friction |
| Real-time voice switching | Global preference is sufficient for MVP |
