title: Add demo widget with terminal simulation

## Problem

The landing page explains Esoterica but doesn't show it in action. Visitors can't see what a tarot reading looks like without installing the tool first. A demo widget would let people experience the interaction before committing.

## Solution

TBD — ideas:

- Interactive terminal simulation showing `/tarot` invocation
- Three example scenarios (e.g., problem-solving, planning, self-mythologizing)
- Pre-recorded card draws with example interpretations
- Could be animated typewriter effect or step-through clicks
- Consider: static card examples vs full simulated conversation flow
