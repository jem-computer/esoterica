## Problem

Currently there's no stated contribution policy on GitHub. We want to make clear that contributions (PRs) are only open to members of the "development coven" - a branded group of invited collaborators. No PRs from random contributors.

## Solution

1. Add a CONTRIBUTING.md or section in README explaining the closed contribution model
2. Keep it friendly but clear - this is an invite-only project
3. The coven itself will be named, branded, and formally created later (separate effort)
4. Consider GitHub repo settings to reflect this (e.g., issue templates, PR templates)
