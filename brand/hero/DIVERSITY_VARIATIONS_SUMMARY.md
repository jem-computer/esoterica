# Diversity-Focused Hero Image Variations

**Generated:** 2026-01-25
**Batch:** 9 (Diversity Emphasis)
**Total Images:** 8 variations

## Problem Identified

Previous hero image generations used the vague phrase "Diverse women" which resulted in all figures appearing as white women, despite the intent for global majority representation.

## Solution Implemented

Created 8 new variations with **explicit diversity language** to achieve true Future California ecotopia vision:
- Global majority emphasis
- Melanin-rich representation
- Ethnicity-ambiguous and mixed heritage
- Multiple continents and ancestries

## User's Favorite Composition

**Base:** hero-2026-01-24T23-43-14-3.png (background figures, blurred)

All new variations maintain this composition style:
- Figures softly blurred in background
- Sacred altar in foreground with tarot cards
- Selenite crystal-computer with terminal screen
- Joshua Tree grove, golden hour sunrise
- Kodak Eastman 100T 5247 film aesthetic
