What if your AI agent could draw tarot cards for complex decisions? Not for fortune-telling—for reframing. For breaking the spell of linear thinking when you're trapped between two paths and your rational mind keeps circling the same dead ends.

## Announcement Post

Esoterica is live. Tarot readings for Claude agents.

Not a novelty—a perspective-shifting framework. 78 cards waiting to reframe your questions. When you're stuck in a refactor that's grown teeth, when the code has become a labyrinth, when linear debugging hits walls—draw. The Tower illuminates what needs to fall. The Hermit's lantern shows paths you weren't seeing. The Chariot demands direction you've been avoiding.

Ancient patterns, new paths. Tarot's archetypal wisdom meeting AI's reasoning engine in the liminal space where both have always secretly touched.

Install the deck:
npm install -g esoterica
